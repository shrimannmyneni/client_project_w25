px: Setting base size for your project (define on body). Typically used minimally, with em doing the brunt of hte work

rem: Setting relative size (headings, body text, etc). Used liberally for 'generic ui elements' and often avoided for specifics.

em: Setting styles inline with your content (subscript, superscript, 'effects' on your items that are dependent on the item's size, etc). Used liberally for 'custom ui elements' and often avoided for generics. iirc it represents uppercase letter scale of the font.

vw/vh: Filling viewports, often used alongside media queries. Typically used for wrappers around your content.

vmin/vmax: Filling viewports based on the smallest/largest available size, often used alongside media queries. Typically used for wrappers around your content.

%: use when parent is a fixed size, or to 100% fill a container, often used alongside media queries. Typically used in subwrappers to scale content.

ch: explicitly defining width of a section of text, typically used for paragraphs and inputs

lh: vertically aligning block elements with text, typically used with inline block elements that need to be aligned along a center horizontal axis

ex: rarely used over em, but typically for vertical measurements of text. iirc represents lowercase letter scale of the font.
