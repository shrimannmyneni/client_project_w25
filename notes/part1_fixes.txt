I would recommend you relabel your files and your links in the navigation to match with the page names (i.e instead of page 2, I would call this "Study Spaces"). That will be a much better user experience for your end user.

Be sure to resolve the errors on the Home, Community, Study Spaces, and Student Health pages.

AXE
Also, be sure to resolve the errors on the Home, Community, and Study Spaces, and submit a screenshot of the Student Health scan with Axe.
